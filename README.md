Question Set 1
(a) State the relationship between the Genus and Species objects. [1]
(b) State the relationship between the Species and Specimen objects. [1]
(c) Construct the unified modelling language (UML) diagram for the Species object. [4]
(d) Outline two ways in which the programming team can benefit from the way the
relationships between the three objects, Specimen, Species and Genus, have been
represented in the code. [4]
(e) The Genus class implements a toString() method that produces an output string that
is different from the one produced by the toString() method in the Species class.
Consider the following code fragment:
Species human = new Species ("homo", "sapiens");
System.out.println(human.toString() );
(i) Outline why calling the toString() method in this code does not cause an error. [2]
(ii) Identify the term for this property. [1]
Question Set 2
(a) Define the term encapsulation. [1]
(b) Outline two benefits provided by encapsulation. [4]
(c) Identify an accessor method in the Specimen class. [1]
(d) Identify an instance variable in the Specimen class. [1]
(e) Construct code for the Genus object including a constructor, accessor methods and a
toString() method. [3]
The Specimen object could have been designed as a sub-class of the Species object.
(f) Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of having the Specimen object as a
sub-class of the Species object. [4]
Question Set 3
(a) Outline the changes that would be needed in order to add a description of each animalâ€™s
individual markings to the program. [4]
An array is used to store the Specimen objects corresponding to the animals in the zoo.
(b) Construct a method countSpecimens( Specimen[] animals, Species s ) that
will output the number of specimens of the given species in the zoo. [8]
(c) Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for listSpecies( Specimen[] animals ),
which will generate a list of the different species in the zoo. [6]
For some operations, it will be more convenient to use a linked list to hold the Specimen
objects corresponding to the animals in the zoo. In answering this question, you should use
the LinkedList class and may use the following methods.
addHead()
getHead()
addTail()
getTail()
getNext()
insert()
delete()
isEmpty()
isFull()
Question Set 4
(a) Identify the features of an abstract data type (ADT). [2]
(b) Construct a method, makeList(), that builds a linked list containing the Specimen
objects from an input array.
LinkedList makeList( Specimen[] animals )
{
// insert your code here
} [4]
(c) Construct a method, makeSpeciesList( LinkedList animals ), that will return
a linked list of Species objects, one for each animal specimen present in the zoo.
Note that the list returned will contain duplicate Species objects if the zoo has more than
one specimen of a given species. [6]
(d) Construct a method, makeSpeciesListUnique( LinkedList allSpecies ), that
will take a linked list of Species objects as described in (c) and produce a new linked list
that contains only one Species object for each species in the zoo. [8]
